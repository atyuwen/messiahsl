# Change Log
All notable changes to the MessiahSL extension will be documented in this file.

## 0.5.0

Added three different lint modes:

* `Lint`: Run a default lint, very fast but only a subset of shader braches are checked.
* `Lint Full (Fast)`: Run a fast lint, try to check all shader branches, but might introduce unexpected syntax errors.
* `Lint Full (Slow)`: Run a full lint, all shader branches will be checked. Might be very SLOW.

## 0.4.0
All compile warnings wil be reported. Set 'messiahsl.suppressWarning' to suppress certain warnings.

## 0.2.0
Initial beta release.
